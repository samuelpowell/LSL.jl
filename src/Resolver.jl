Construct a continuous resolver which resolves all streams on the network.

                        was shut down), this is the time in seconds after which it is no

  ContinuousResolver(prop = "", value = ""; forget_after = 5.0)

Construct a continuous resolver that resolves all streams with a specific value for a
given property.

This is analogous to the functionality provided by the function resolve_stream(prop,value).

# Arguments
-`prop::String`: The StreamInfo property that should have a specific value (e.g., "name",
"type", "source_id", or "desc/manufaturer").
-`value::String`: The string value that the property should have (e.g., "EEG" as the type
                         property).

# Keyword arguments
-`forget_after::Number`: When a stream is no longer visible on the network (e.g., because it
                        was shut down), this is the time in seconds after which it is no

"""
  ContinuousResolver(predicate; forget_after = 5.0)

Construct a new continuous resolver that resolves all streams that match a given XPath
1.0 predicate.

This is analogous to the functionality provided by the free function resolve_bypred

# Arugments
-`predicate::String`: Predicate string, e.g. "name='BioSemi'" or "type='EEG' and
starts-with(name,'BioSemi') and count(description/desc/channels/channel)=32"

# Keyword arguments

                        was shut down), this is the time in seconds after which it is no

"""
    resolve_streams(;timeout = 1.0)

Returns all currently available streams from any outlet on the network. 

The network is usually the subnet specified at the local router, but may also include a
group of machines visible to each other via multicast packets (given that the network
supports it), or list of hostnames. These details may optionally be customized by the
experimenter in a configuration file (see Network Connectivity in the LSL wiki).  
                         
Returns a vector of StreamInfo objects (with empty desc field), any of which can
subsequently be used to open an inlet. The full description can be retrieved from the inlet.

# Keyword arguments:
-`timeout`: The waiting time for the operation, in seconds, to search for streams. Warning:
            If this is too short (<0.5s) only a subset (or none) of the outlets that are
            present on the network may be returned.

"""
    resolve_byprop(prop, value; minimum = 1, timeout = LSL_FOREVER)

Resolve all streams with a specific value for a given property.

If the goal is to resolve a specific stream, this method is preferred over resolving all
streams and then selecting the desired one.

Returns a vector of matching StreamInfo objects (with empty desc field), any of which can
subsequently be used to open an inlet.

# Arguments
-`prop::String`: The StreamInfo property that should have a specific value (e.g., "name",
                "type", "source_id", or "desc/manufaturer").
-`value::String`: The string value that the property should have (e.g., "EEG" as the type
                 property).

# Keyword arguments
-`minimum::Integer`: Return at least this many streams.
-`timeout::Number`: A timeout of the operation, in seconds. If the timeout expires, less than
                   the desired number of streams (possibly none) will be returned.

Resolve all streams that match a given predicate.
   
Advanced query that allows to impose more conditions on the retrieved streams; the given
string is an XPath 1.0 predicate for the <description> node (omitting the surrounding []'s),
see also http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=XPath_1.0&oldid=474981951.
